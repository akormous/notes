I am a Software Engineer by profession but I also like doing other stuff, like learning piano, playing PC games, scripting and editing videos and reading books.\\n\\nI also have an obsession of taking notes of whatever I study, whether it is technology, philosophy, money or life. So, I thought it would be great if I share my notes with the rest of the world, and this is how this website was born.\\nThere is something to read here for every age group. \\n\\nIf you find any errors/typos, please drop an email [iamakshatchauhan@gmail.com](mailto:iamakshatchauhan@gmail.com).\\n\\nOr if you\'re smart, create a pull request by clicking on `Edit this page` button at the bottom of any document page.\\n\\nCheers :)"}]}')}}]);
