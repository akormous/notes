This is the first blog post of my life.

My name is Akshat and I am 23 years old. I am a Software Engineer by profession but I also like doing other stuff, like learning piano, playing PC games, scripting and editing videos and reading books.

I also have an obsession of taking notes of whatever I study, whether it is technology, philosophy, money or life. So, I thought it would be great if I share my notes with the rest of the world, and this is how this website was born.
There is something to read here for every age group. 

If you find any errors/typos, please drop an email [iamakshatchauhan@gmail.com](mailto:iamakshatchauhan@gmail.com).

Cheers :)
