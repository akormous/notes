            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first blog post of my life.</p><p>My name is Akshat and I am 23 years old. I am a Software Engineer by profession but I also like doing other stuff, like learning piano, playing PC games, scripting and editing videos and reading books.</p><p>I also have an obsession of taking notes of whatever I study, whether it is technology, philosophy, money or life. So, I thought it would be great if I share my notes with the rest of the world, and this is how this website was born.
There is something to read here for every age group. </p><p>If you find any errors/typos, please drop an email <a href="mailto:iamakshatchauhan@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iamakshatchauhan@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>Or if you're smart, create a pull request by clicking on <code>Edit this page</code> button at the bottom of any document page.</p><p>Cheers :)</p>]]></content:encoded>
