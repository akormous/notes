# Math and Logic Puzzles

## Math Concepts
<details>
    <summary>Prime Number Law</summary>

- Every positive integer can be decomposed into a product of primes
- In order for a number `x` to divide a number `y`, `(y/x)` or `y%x = 0`,
<br />all primes in `x`'s prime factorization must be in `y`'s prime factorization

<details>
    <summary>Sieve of Eratosthenes</summary>

- Highly efficient way to generate a list of primes
- It works by recognizing that all non-prime numbers are divisible by a prime number

<details>
    <summary>Independence</summary>

- If A and B are independent, then `P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)`
- _If one event tells nothing about the other event._

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Mutual Exclusivity</summary>

- If A and B are mutually exclusive, then `P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)`
- and `P(A and B) = 0`
- _If one event occurs, then the other cannot occur._
